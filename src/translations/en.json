    "q1": "What does a Coffee Broker actually do?",
    "a1": "A coffee broker connects coffee producers, exporters, and buyers to facilitate transparent, efficient, and secure transactions. By acting as intermediaries, brokers help negotiate contracts, ensure quality standards, and manage logistics. They act as intermediaries to secure the best prices and reduce operational risks.",
    "q2": "How can working with a Coffee Broker benefit my coffee business?",
    "a2": "Working with a coffee broker provides access to a wider network of buyers and sellers, expert market intelligence, and streamlined contract negotiation. Brokers help you secure better pricing, reduce risk, and save time by handling complex logistics and documentation.",
    "q3": "What factors influence coffee prices in the global market?",
    "a3": "Coffee prices are influenced by supply and demand dynamics, weather conditions affecting harvests, currency fluctuations, geopolitical events, and commodity market trends. Brokers monitor these factors to provide clients with timely insights and strategic advice.",
    "q4": "What is the difference between a Coffee Broker and a Coffee Trader?",
    "a4": "A coffee broker facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers without taking ownership of the coffee, earning a commission. A coffee trader, on the other hand, buys and sells coffee on their own account, taking on inventory risk and aiming to profit from price movements."
