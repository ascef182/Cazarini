    content: `Speaking to and visiting multiple cooperatives and private exporters/warehouses during last week in Cerrado and South Minas, I've heard selling activity improved a bit but not in an abysmal way.
    
    It's clear to them all that producers have more coffee to sell in comparison to last years at this time of the year. Expectations is that for Arabica there is still 20-30% left of crop 25/26. Whereas this % was due at the end of November in the last years.
    
    So the wait game puts them in a blurry risk reward position. Yes, destination stocks don't rise , while the coffee sits here. How long they can wait? A lot longer for sure, and even can stock for multiple crops a good part of production as some larger producers do.
    
    But the question is, will this strategy work like it did in the last 2 to 3 years? A simple provocative question. Differentials at levels never seen before. Off season won't change dramatically but new crop is each day closer and Brazil will always sell at some stage.`,

    The general narrative is consistent across regions: consumption has not shown a sharp decline, and some even suggest it may be slightly increasing on a global scale.
    
    Despite Brazil’s strong and surprisingly consistent export volumes over the past three months, pipeline inventories have not been significantly replenished. For many, the current market inversion poses a greater challenge than high interest rates or Brazil’s firm differentials, which are expected to ease with the full arrival of the 2025 crop — at least, that is the prevailing expectation, even if it proves to be a brief window.
    
    Trading houses are expecting to receive stocks in direct proportion to what their clients consume — not a grain more or less, and in many cases, even less than needed. Amid this tightness, we are relying on flawless logistics in Brazil, which we know is unlikely. Logistics may become even more strained with the harvest’s arrival.
    
    The rally in New York to 400 cts/lb was expected to translate into significantly higher prices for end-consumers. However, up until now, the actual impact has been lighter than anticipated. There is notable concern surrounding the Brazilian winter and the second half of the year — particularly regarding rainfall and temperatures — factors that will be closely and consistently monitored.
    
    Next year’s crop carries tremendous potential, and we cannot afford to miss it — assuming there is anything we can do to influence the outcome. The conviction remains that the market will continue to exhibit sharp upward movements and corrections, with a bias toward more frequent bullish moments than bearish ones.
    
    Nominal prices remain high, which has reduced the typical harvest-related selling pressure. Where a producer once needed to sell ten bags to cover costs, today, only three may suffice. This summarizes fifteen days in the field, gathering relevant insights to help us understand what may or may not lie ahead.`,

    content: `Quick handbook note... January pace of exports continue on the high side.
    
    As pictured some weeks ago, the chase for the real crop number of last year would be defined together with the shipments performance of Q1 Q2 2025. If the pace remains above 3.5 per month, mathematically it's easy to pin a crop above 70mi bags in cycle 24/25 with our domestic market almost 22mi bags.
    
    Such scenario can also enlighten a global resilient demand since destination stocks aren't building and the use of certified stocks can pick up fastly with Brazil basis (diffs) very high even with KC prices above 360/370cts now.
    
    Brazil Central Bank just raised interest rates to 13.25% a year, up 1% making BRL to gain and hold value lately towards 5.80/5.70 (which remains to be seen if consolidates here or weakens in any political tension on government spending or tax reforms). A stronger BRL plays against cheaper diffs and usually not the case of influence to KC market as some would think, this correlation mainly matter when producers want to sell, which isn't the case in Brazil for an extended time already.
    
    Latest domestic market businesses have been as high as 2600 BRL for certified coffee (RFA) and 2550, both versus fancy qualities (fine cups).`,

    content: `I was asked where Brazilian producers sell coffee again, for the current crop, in decent volumes.
    
    Considering their mentality, firstly, they are more frequently sellers when they are facing bills to pay, like farm care (fertilizer, chemicals, pruning, etc), picking costs, or buying a new asset, be it another farm, land, machinery... For the moment they don't have a lot of cash outflow going on and harvest a few months away.
    
    Whoever has stocks now are medium/large producers. Within their expectations, crossing it vs overseas expectations too (basis, differentials), I'd say market needs to be at 400/410 to see a bigger flow of fine cups priced around -10 basis to end up rewarding them BRL2500.
    
    If we see it, it's another story. There are other coffees in between 340/400-410 NY levels that the market probably buys first, but ultimately it's a possibility Brazilian farmers could strike again a good deal by holding for 3 to 4 more months... but can also be a mistake. For now I simply don't see them under a price threat.
    
    However, new crop dynamics might change and fall into cheaper levels both flat and diffs.`,

    preview: "In a market increasingly driven by quality differentiation, understanding what qualifies as specialty coffee is essential for any serious buyer...",
    content: `In a market increasingly driven by quality differentiation, understanding what qualifies as specialty coffee is essential for any serious buyer. The Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) defines specialty coffee as any lot scoring 80 points or above on a 100-point scale during a professional cupping session.

    But what does that actually mean in practice? It means zero primary defects in a 350-gram green sample. It means flavor clarity — whether that's a bright citrus acidity from a washed Alta Mogiana lot, or the sweet chocolate and dried fruit notes from a natural-processed Cerrado bean.

    From a commercial standpoint, specialty coffee commands premiums that can range from 20% to over 200% above commodity prices, depending on score, origin traceability, and certification. For producers, the economics are compelling: higher revenue per hectare, stronger buyer relationships, and insulation from the extreme volatility of the commodity market.

    At Cazarini, we've seen a consistent year-over-year increase in demand for lots scoring 84+, particularly from roasters in Japan, Northern Europe, and the US West Coast. The trend is clear — the global palate is evolving, and origins that can deliver consistent quality with full traceability are building lasting partnerships.

    The challenge remains in scaling quality without sacrificing what makes it special. That balance — between volume and exclusivity — is where the best trading relationships are built.`,

    content: `Rainforest Alliance, 4C, Fair Trade, UTZ — the alphabet soup of certifications can be overwhelming. But understanding each one's requirements, costs, and market value is critical for both producers and buyers navigating the modern coffee supply chain.

    Let's break it down from a practical standpoint.

    Rainforest Alliance (RAS) has become the de facto standard for large-volume commercial buyers. After merging with UTZ in 2018, it now covers over 5 million hectares globally. For Brazilian producers, compliance requires documented agrochemical use, worker welfare programs, and shade-tree management. The premium is modest — typically $0.01-0.03/lb — but the market access it unlocks is significant.

    4C (Common Code for the Coffee Community) is the entry-level certification. Think of it as the minimum bar for responsible production. It's less demanding than RAS but increasingly required by European roasters responding to the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR).

    Fair Trade remains popular with consumer-facing brands but is less common in commercial-grade Brazilian coffee. Its minimum price guarantee ($1.40/lb for washed Arabica) can actually fall below market when NY is trading at 350+, making the fixed premium ($0.20/lb) the real value driver.

    The EUDR, effective December 2024, is reshaping the entire certification landscape. Every lot entering the EU must now be traceable to the plot of land where it was produced, with satellite-verified proof of no deforestation after December 31, 2020. This is a game-changer for the industry.

    At Cazarini, we support producers through each of these programs and help buyers source certified lots that match their compliance and marketing needs. The key is choosing the right certification for your market — not chasing all of them.`,

    content: `After the devastating frosts of 2021, Brazilian producers have become hyper-aware of climate risk. The cold snap that year wiped out an estimated 10% of Brazil's Arabica production capacity, and the market is still feeling the reverberations.

    Fast forward to 2025, and the picture is complex. El Niño officially transitioned to neutral ENSO conditions in late 2024, which historically favors more predictable rainfall patterns in key producing regions like South Minas, Cerrado, and Mogiana.

    However, two concerning factors persist. First, accumulated heat stress during flowering periods (September-October 2024) was above average in parts of Cerrado, which can reduce cherry set. Preliminary field reports suggest uneven maturation in several municipalities, which could affect quality consistency more than total volume.

    Second, water table levels in key irrigation zones remain below 10-year averages. While Brazil's Arabica is predominantly rain-fed, the roughly 15% that relies on supplemental irrigation — including much of the specialty production in Patrocínio and Monte Carmelo — faces tighter margins if the dry season extends.

    The bullish thesis remains intact: Brazil's 2025/26 harvest has tremendous potential on a biennial 'on-year' cycle. CONAB's latest estimate sits at 66-70 million bags. But as we've learned, potential and reality don't always align. One poorly timed frost in July could rewrite the entire narrative.

    Smart positioning right now means forward-covering your core needs while maintaining optionality for weather-driven price movements. The market is pricing in a large crop — any disappointment will produce sharp, fast rallies.`,

    preview: "The traditional price relationship between Arabica and Robusta has been turned on its head. Understanding why matters for every buyer...",
    content: `The traditional price relationship between Arabica and Robusta has been turned on its head. For decades, Robusta traded at a consistent 40-60% discount to Arabica. Today, that spread has narrowed dramatically, and the implications are profound for the global supply chain.

    Vietnam's 2023/24 Robusta crop came in well below expectations — drought stress during the critical bean-filling phase reduced output by an estimated 10-15%. Meanwhile, Indonesia's contribution has plateaued, and India's exports face logistical bottlenecks. The result? London Robusta futures breached $5,000/ton for the first time ever in 2024.

    For Brazilian Conilon (the local Robusta variety), this created a unique opportunity. Brazil's Conilon production — concentrated in Espírito Santo and parts of Bahia and Rondônia — has been growing steadily, now accounting for roughly 20 million bags annually. With Vietnamese Robusta tight, Brazilian Conilon has stepped in to fill the gap, particularly for soluble coffee manufacturers.

    The squeeze is being felt most by blenders. Traditional Italian espresso blends, which relied on cheap Robusta to balance cost and crema, now face margin compression. Some large roasters have responded by increasing the Arabica content in blends — a move that would have been unthinkable at old spread levels.

    For pure Arabica buyers, the narrowing spread is less directly impactful but still matters. When Robusta is expensive, it reduces substitution pressure on lower-grade Arabica (Rios and Riados), which can pull the floor under commodity Arabica prices.

    The key takeaway: the old paradigm of "cheap Robusta, expensive Arabica" is evolving. Buyers who adapt their procurement strategies to this new reality will be better positioned.`,

    content: `Santos handles over 60% of Brazil's coffee exports, making it the world's single most important coffee logistics hub. For anyone sourcing Brazilian coffee, understanding how this port operates — and its current challenges — is essential.

    The port processes roughly 25 million bags of coffee annually across multiple terminals. The bulk of coffee moves through dedicated warehouses in the Santos port complex, where containers are stuffed, sealed, and loaded onto vessels bound for every major consuming market.

    Current transit times from Santos illustrate the global reach: 12-15 days to Northern Europe, 18-22 days to the US East Coast, 35-40 days to Japan and South Korea, and 25-30 days to the Mediterranean. These windows are critical for planning arrival stocks and coverage.

    The logistics chain begins well before the port. Inland freight from producing regions like South Minas (roughly 400km), Cerrado (600km), and Mogiana (350km) typically takes 1-2 days by truck. GPS-tracked dedicated coffee containers ensure chain of custody and quality preservation during transit.

    One ongoing challenge is congestion. During peak shipping months (June-September, coinciding with the main harvest), truck queues at Santos can extend waiting times by 2-3 days. We've mitigated this at Cazarini by maintaining flexible warehouse capacity near the port and establishing priority booking relationships with major shipping lines.

    Documentation is another critical piece. Every export requires a phytosanitary certificate (issued by MAPA), a certificate of origin, ICO certificate of origin, commercial invoice, packing list, and bill of lading. Errors in documentation can delay shipments by weeks — which is why we handle this process end-to-end for our clients.

    The EUDR is adding a new layer of complexity from 2025 onward. Every lot must now carry geolocation data traceable to the specific farm or cooperative where the coffee was produced. We've invested in digital traceability tools to ensure our clients are fully compliant from day one.`,

    content: `Natural, washed, honey, anaerobic — processing methods have become as important as variety and terroir in defining a coffee's character. For buyers building blends or sourcing single-origins, understanding these methods is no longer optional.

    Natural (dry) processing is Brazil's traditional method and still accounts for the majority of production. The cherry is dried whole on patios or raised beds, allowing the fruit sugars to ferment and permeate the bean. The result: heavy body, low acidity, and pronounced sweetness — think chocolate, dried fruit, and nuts. Naturals are the backbone of espresso blends worldwide.

    Washed (wet) processing involves removing the fruit before drying the parchment coffee. This produces a cleaner, brighter cup with more defined acidity. Washed Brazilian coffees from regions like Alta Mogiana and Chapada Diamantina have gained significant traction among specialty buyers who value clarity over body.

    Honey processing sits between the two. The cherry skin is removed but some or all of the mucilage (the sticky, sugar-rich layer) remains during drying. "Black honey" retains the most mucilage and produces a profile closer to naturals; "white honey" retains the least and leans toward washed characteristics.

    Anaerobic and controlled fermentation is the frontier. By fermenting cherries or depulped beans in sealed, oxygen-free tanks, producers can manipulate flavor development with remarkable precision. We're seeing lots from Minas Gerais and São Paulo that rival the complexity of the best East African coffees — winey, fruit-forward, with floral aromatics that were unimaginable in Brazilian coffee a decade ago.

    The commercial reality: processing innovation is creating new value tiers within Brazilian coffee. A natural Cerrado might trade at -10 to +5 basis, while an anaerobic natural from the same region could fetch +40 to +80. For buyers willing to explore, the flavor-to-value ratio in Brazilian processed coffees has never been better.`,
